##
# This script deletes log files that are created by various kinds of log file rotations.
#
# Syntax:
# 
#     rm-rotaed-files [dir]
# 
# Example to process the current directory and all subdirectories:
# 
#     rm-rotaed-files 
#
# Example to process a specific directory:
# 
#     rm-rotaed-files /var/log
#
#
# ## Which files?
#
# Compressed files: 
# 
#   * Files with extensions that are known to be compressed or archived.
# 
#   * Examples: .bz2, .bzip, .gz, .tar, .tgz, .zip, .7zip
# 
# Old files:
#
#  * Files with extensions that are typically for old files.
#
#  * Examples: .old, .bak, .tmp
#
# Numbered files:
# 
#   * Files with names that end in a separator then number:
# 
#   * Examples: foo.1, foo-2, foo_3, etc.
# 
# Datestamped files:
#
#   * Files with names that end in a separator then ISO date.
#
#   * Examples: foo-2017-12-31, foo_2017_12_31, etc.
#
#
# ## Compatibility notes
#
# We prefer to be more compatible rather than system-specific.
#
#   * To delete files, we prefer `-exec rm` vs. `-delete`.
#     The former is more compatible, the latter is faster.
#
#   * To name match, we prefer using `-name` vs. `-iname`.
#     This means we need to match on upper case and lower case.
#
#   * To regex match, we prefer patterns to be basic vs. extended.
#     The former is more compatible, the latter is more modern.
#
#   * We prefer POSIX code vs. shell-specific code.
#
#   * We prefer the code to be more DAMP than DRY.
#     For example, the code has separate name matching 
#     for `.bz` and `.bz2`, even though we could combine these.
